- Game Overview:

This project is a Java-based Space Invader game built with the JOGL (Java OpenGL) library. The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must destroy waves of descending alien monsters. The goal is to eliminate all the monsters before they reach the spaceship. If all monsters are destroyed, the player wins and is directed to a victory screen. However, if any monster reaches the spaceship, it results in a "You Lose" screen.

### Features

- Player Control:

The player controls the spaceship's horizontal movement using keyboard inputs.

The spaceship can fire projectiles to destroy alien monsters.

- Alien Monsters:

Monsters move in a wave-like pattern and descend gradually toward the spaceship.

Each monster can be destroyed with a projectile hit.

- Game Mechanics:

If all monsters are eliminated, the player is directed to a victory screen.

If any monster reaches the bottom of the screen (near the spaceship), the game transitions to a "You Lose" screen.

- Java Object-Oriented Design:

The game uses various Java classes to represent entities such as the spaceship, monsters, projectiles, and the game engine.

Each class encapsulates specific behaviors and attributes, following the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).

- Graphics and Animations:

The game leverages the JOGL library for rendering 2D graphics and animations.

Smooth transitions and real-time rendering enhance the gameplay experience.
